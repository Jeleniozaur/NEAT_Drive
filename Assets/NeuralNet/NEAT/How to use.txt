1. Attach NeuralNet in creature prefab and setup your layers counts;
2. Attach FitnessData in creature prefab
3. Make a script that communicate with FitnessData and change FitnessData.fitness to your liking.
4. Drop NEAT prefab anywhere in space.
5. You might want to drop NeuralNet_UI prefab to avoid errors.

Use NeuralNet.setInputValue for layers[0] and NeuralNet.getOutputValue for layers[count-1]
